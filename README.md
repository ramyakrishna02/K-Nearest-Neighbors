# K Nearest Neighbour Classifier
The k-nearest neighbors algorithm, also known as KNN or k-NN, is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point

The k-nearest neighbor classifier is a machine learning algorithm that assigns a new data point to the class that is most common among its k closest neighbors.
It is based on the idea that similar data points tend to have similar labels. 
The k-nearest neighbor classifier can be used for both classification and regression problems, but it is more commonly used for classification.
